Got it 👍 Let’s break this down in **simple steps**.

The **1.5 × IQR rule** is a common way to detect **outliers** in data.

### Steps to Identify Outliers (1.5 × IQR rule)

1. **Arrange the data** in ascending order.

2. **Find Q1 and Q3**:

   * **Q1 (25th percentile)** → the value below which 25% of the data falls.
   * **Q3 (75th percentile)** → the value below which 75% of the data falls.

3. **Calculate IQR**:

   $$
   IQR = Q3 - Q1
   $$

4. **Find the lower and upper bounds**:

   * **Lower Bound** = Q1 – (1.5 × IQR)
   * **Upper Bound** = Q3 + (1.5 × IQR)

5. **Identify outliers**:

   * Any data value **< Lower Bound** is an outlier.
   * Any data value **> Upper Bound** is an outlier.

### Example

Suppose we have this dataset:

$$
[2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 18, 25]
$$

1. Ordered data (already sorted).
2. **Q1 = 5**, **Q3 = 15**.
3. **IQR = 15 – 5 = 10**.
4. **Lower Bound = 5 – (1.5 × 10) = 5 – 15 = -10**
   **Upper Bound = 15 + (1.5 × 10) = 15 + 15 = 30**
5. Outliers = Values < -10 or > 30.
   → In this dataset, **no outliers**.

👉 If you give me a dataset, I can calculate the outliers step by step for you.
Do you want me to show you how to do this in **Python code** too?
