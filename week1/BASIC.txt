1. Nominal Scale
Definition: Categories without any order.
Examples:
Gender (Male, Female, Other)
Colors (Red, Blue, Green)
Types of fruits (Apple, Banana, Mango)
Key Point: You can name or label the data, but you cannot rank or order them.


2. Ordinal Scale
Definition: Categories with a meaningful order, but the differences between ranks are not measurable.
Examples:
Education level (High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD)
Customer satisfaction (Poor < Fair < Good < Excellent)
Key Point: You can rank the data, but you cannot quantify the difference between ranks.

3. Discrete Data
Definition: Countable data, often whole numbers.
Examples:
Number of students in a class
Number of cars in a parking lot
Number of bugs in a software module
Key Point: These are quantitative values that can be counted, not measured.

4. Continuous Data
Definition: Measurable data that can take any value within a range.
Examples:
Height, weight, temperature, time
CPU usage percentage
Key Point: These are quantitative values that can be measured, and they can include fractions or decimals.
Types of Continuous Data:
a. Interval Scale
Definition: Ordered data with equal intervals, but no true zero.
Examples:
Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
Dates (e.g., years like 1990, 2000)
Key Point: You can add and subtract, but ratios are meaningless (e.g., 20°C is not "twice as hot" as 10°C).
b. Ratio Scale
Definition: Ordered data with equal intervals and a true zero.
Examples:
Height, weight, age, income
Time duration
Key Point: You can do all arithmetic operations, including meaningful ratios (e.g., 20 kg is twice as heavy as 10 kg).
